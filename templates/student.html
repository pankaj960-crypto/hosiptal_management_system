                       <p class="p">Madhubani Medical College is the brain child of our Visionary Educationist and Founder Dr. Faiyaz Ahmad. He has been working tirelessly in improving the education quality and providing best facilities to the students of this region for the last 33 years. Madhubani is a district where best of the best minds exist but the problem has been proper nurturing of those, the students from the region had to always look to the bigger cities for quality education. It’s the same with the health care facilities which are of very poor standards available to the local people around town. Sighting these reasons Madhubani Medical College came into inception. Madhubani Medical College’s campus is spread over 25 Acres with fully equipped and operational 720 bedded hospital within campus and situated in Madhubani town. The campus is well connected and is on par with best medical colleges in the country. The unitary campus consists of College Building, Hospital Building, Hostels for Students, Residents and Nurses, quarter for Teaching and Non Teaching Staff.</p>
